# Java-based-P2P-chat

This Java-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) chat application enables local communication, allowing users to exchange messages seamlessly within a network. The application offers two distinct modes of connection: direct connection using the recipient's IP address and port, or through a STUN server registration for centralized contact management.

Features:
Local P2P Communication:

Users can engage in real-time messaging within the local network.
Direct connection option for communicating with known IP addresses and ports.
STUN Server Integration:

Utilizes a STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server for managing contacts.
Users can register on the STUN server to store and retrieve contact information.
Simplifies the process of connecting with others by centralizing contact details.
Contact Management:

Allows users to save and view contacts through the STUN server.
Retrieval of necessary connection information from the server for establishing connections.
